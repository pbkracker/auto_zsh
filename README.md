auto_zsh
========

A few scripts to auto-install my favorite CLI development tools like zsh, oh-my-zsh, brew, pip, flake8, virtualenvwrapper, vundle, a number of preferred vundles, and git-flow

inter_zsh.sh is an interactive installer

    sh -c "$(curl zsh.sh/zsh.sh)"

vimrc.txt and zshrc.txt are optionally downloaded to replace ~/.vimrc and ~/.zshrc
